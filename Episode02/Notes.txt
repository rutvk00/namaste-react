React makes our app fast in some extent but there are other packages which are used to make our application fast.
NPM (Package Manager) => NPM manages lots of packages but it does not stands for node package manager. For Example : Like google === internet
package.json => It is configuration for NPM.
Bundler => Bundler is bundle/packages our application so it can be shift to production properly. It will gives our app muscel (Without it App is just skelotone) For Example : webpack,vite,parcel  
Dependecies : 
    1. Dev-dependencies = Dependecies which are used while developing phase.
    2. Normal dependencies = Dependecies which are also used while production phase.

package.json : It track of all the dependencies and version of it's and application.
package-lock.json : It track of initial version of all thr dependencies. (lock the version of dependencies)

Transitive Dependecies (node_modules) : Our app => parcel => some dependencies => some dependencies ....
Every dependencies have their own package.json

No need to push node_modules on to the git and production , because with the help of package.json and package-lock.json we can re-create node_modules using command -- `npm install`
